# MLPyVersioneer Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for MLPyVersioneer, a robust Python module designed to streamline the process of capturing, storing, and managing critical details of machine learning models during their training phase. As machine learning experiments can yield a variety of models across multiple iterations, keeping track of each model's specifics becomes vital. This is where MLPyVersioneer comes into play.

## Overview

The primary aim of MLPyVersioneer is to provide an organized structure to:

1. **Summarize Model Details**: Store essential details about machine learning models, including hyperparameters, architecture, and performance metrics.
2. **Versioning of Models**: Automatically determine and manage model versions based on previously stored details.
3. **Metric Management**: Offer a structured approach to capture, store, and retrieve training phase metrics, thereby allowing for a granular analysis of model training progress across epochs.
4. **Exporter Utility**: Simplify the process of saving both model checkpoints and their associated metadata, ensuring that no crucial information is lost over the course of iterative model development.
5. **Visualization and Export**: Facilitate the export of training metrics to various formats, including CSV and JSON, and provide visualization capabilities for a quick analysis of model performance metrics over epochs.

Whether you're an ML practitioner aiming to keep your experiments organized or a team lead looking to standardize the model tracking process across projects, MLPyVersioneer provides the necessary tools to make your workflow smoother and more efficient.

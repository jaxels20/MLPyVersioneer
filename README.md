# PyMLVersioneer - Python Machine Learning Model Versioning Library

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

PyMLVersioneer is a Python library designed to simplify the versioning and management of machine learning models. With PyMLVersioneer, you can easily track and organize different versions of your trained models, making it a valuable tool for machine learning developers and MLOps practitioners.

## Features

- Effortlessly version your machine learning models and associated metadata.
- Keep track of model changes and updates over time.
- Integrate versioning into your machine learning workflows.
- Seamlessly work with popular machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, etc.

## Installation

You can install PyMLVersioneer using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pymlversioneer
Getting Started
Basic Usage
python
Copy code
import pymlversioneer as mlv

# Load your trained model (example: scikit-learn RandomForestClassifier)
model = mlv.load_model("path/to/your/trained_model.pkl")

# Record the version of this model
model_version = mlv.record_version(model, metadata={"author": "John Doe", "description": "Initial version"})

# Later, when you make changes and train a new version:
new_model = train_new_model()
new_model_version = mlv.record_version(new_model, metadata={"author": "Jane Smith", "description": "Improved accuracy"})

# List all available versions
all_versions = mlv.list_versions()

# Restore a specific version
specific_version_model = mlv.restore_version(version_id)

# Compare two versions
mlv.compare_versions(version_id_1, version_id_2)
Advanced Usage
For more advanced usage and integration with MLOps workflows, please refer to the Documentation for detailed examples and guidelines.
